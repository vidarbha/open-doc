# Introduction
OpenDoc is a simple and easy way to make documents easily searchable and available to the public. You can modify, track changes and submit edit requests easily on the platform. This can be done through the web interface or locally on your computer.

## Features

**Mobile responsive**

All documents that are shared on the site will be mobile responsive by default! We take care of the design so that you can focus on the content!

**Elastic Search**

You're no longer bounded by exact keyword search. Make use of elasticsearch to search through your documents quickly and accurately.

**Speedy surfing**

Opendoc is essentially a static site with no backend integration at all. You no longer have to wait minutes for a site to get loaded, and all sites get loaded in milliseconds!

## Important concepts

**Github & Github pages**

Github is a popular "Version Control System" used by engineers around the world to manage large scale projects. Github pages is a feature provided by Github that allows users to create static websites without having to set up any servers.

**Markdown formatting**

All documents on OpenDoc are stored in a non-proprietary format called Markdown. 

Markdown is a simple text-based markup language and conversion tool that allows writers to create great content for the web without having to worry too much about writing code. The syntax of the language is designed to be easy to learn and intuitive.

**Markdown flavours**

Markdown comes in different flavours to fit the needs of each use case. 

For OpenDoc, we are making use of the "insert-markdown-flavour-name" flavour, plus some additional customised styles to simulate features found in typical document processing applications. The custom styles will be defined in this document, and will be accompanied with samples to make it easier to start your OpenDoc document.
