<h2 id="what-is-sdx">What is SDX?</h2>

<p><strong>SDX</strong> stands for <strong>Sensors Data Exchange</strong>, a centralized sensor data exchange platform for the Whole-of-Government (WOG). It is part of the Strategic National Project under Smart Nation Solutions Platform (SNSP).</p>

<p><strong>SDX</strong> enables government agencies and individuals to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Publish and subscribe real-time sensor data using a self-service portal both on-premise and in the commercial cloud.</li>
  <li>Share unclassified (potentially up to restricted) sensor data with government sector organisations and individuals.</li>
</ul>
