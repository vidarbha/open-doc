# Getting Started

**Sensors Data Exchange 2.0 (SDX 2.0)** is a browser-based application that enable government agencies to share real-time information between each other through a self-service portal, on-premise and commercial cloud.

To get started in using the application:

1. Click this [link](https://sdx.sensors.gov.sg/sdx/home) and sign up using a valid agency email address (e.g. @tech.gov.sg). 

2. System will send an email notification to your email inbox. Click link to verify and proceed to sign up.

3. On first sign up within organization, your role will be a **PUBLISHER**. 

   On second sign up with the same organization, your role will be a **SUBSCRIBER**.

   You can now share information, browse to latest topics, and create your own projects and topics.

You can send a request through email to <sense@tech.gov.sg> to change the role as Administrator to access Administrative features such as manage users.

4. As a Publisher to publish your relevant information, you must first create your Project to create a topic. You can   also subscribe to your own topic. 

   A topic cannot be duplicated and cannot published and subscribed to the same project again. 
   
   Both Publisher and Subscriber can create a project, but only the Publisher can create topic. 
   
**Here is an example use case scenario:**
   
Agency A - National Environment Agency (NEA) will publish and share environment-related information about "Rainfall". 

In SDX portal, NEA will create a Project "Rainfall" and create topic about total rainfall for the month and publish it. 

A subscription approval is needed for other agency (Agency B - Land Transportation Authority (LTA)) to subscribes to this topic.
